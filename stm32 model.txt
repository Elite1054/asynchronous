stm32

Data Collection:
Use the same data collection method but with STM32-specific libraries.

Training the Model:
Train a simple model on a PC using Python (similar to Raspberry Pi).

Deployment:
Export the model to a format that STM32 can use, such as a TensorFlow Lite model.

import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('gait_model.h5')


converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()


with open('gait_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
